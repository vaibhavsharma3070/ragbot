# RAG Chatbot with Pinecone and GPT-4

This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot using Pinecone as a vector database and OpenAI's GPT-4 for response generation.

## Features

- PDF document ingestion and embedding storage in Pinecone
- Efficient retrieval of relevant passages for user queries
- GPT-4 powered response generation
- Handling of multiple document uploads
- Fallback mechanism for unanswerable queries
- Streaming responses for quick initial output

## Tools and Libraries

- Python 3.8+
- Pinecone for vector storage
- LangChain for document processing and chatbot implementation
- OpenAI's GPT-4 for language modeling
- PyPDF2 for PDF parsing

## Limitations and Assumptions

- Assumes the availability of Pinecone and OpenAI API keys
- PDF documents are assumed to be text-based and readable
- Response quality depends on the accuracy of document ingestion and retrieval

## Future Improvements

- Implement more robust error handling and input validation
- Optimize embedding and retrieval processes for larger document sets
- Enhance the user interface for a more interactive experience
